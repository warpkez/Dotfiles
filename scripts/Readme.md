## About

### lock.sh

Using swaylock and a predefined background image to lock the screen.

### poweroff-rofi.sh

Using rofi to display a menu to shutdown, reboot, logout or lock the system.

### poweroff-wofi.sh

Similar to poweroff-rofi.sh but using wofi instead of rofi.

The catch with wofi is it will re-order the menu items based on the last time they were selected. This means the menu items will not be in the same order every time.
